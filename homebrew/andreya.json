Drawing on the powers of the mind to share secrets and learn from those they trust, thaumaturges combine their sharp intellect with veneration of beings of a higher power, both divine and otherwise. Their magic is largely primal, but the learned nature of their specialized covens allows them to expand their bailiwick to other spheres of magical influence. With a mind of study, and the ability to channel divine power, the thaumaturge is no ordinary spellcaster."
