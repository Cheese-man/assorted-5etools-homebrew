# Assorted 5e Homebrew

A collection of homebrew for DnD 5(.5)e that I've converted to JSON for 5eTools.

## Adding to 5eTools

1. Go to [5eTools](https://5e.tools/index.html).
2. At the navigation bar at the top of the page, click the 'Utilities' tab.
3. Click 'Homebrew Manager'. Under the navigation bar, click 'Load from URL'.
4. Paste the 'raw' github link to the file you want, e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cheese-man/assorted-5etools-homebrew/refs/heads/main/homebrew/andreya.json

(You can get the 'raw' link by going into the homebrew folder in this repository, viewing the file, and then clicking the 'Raw' button above it.)
5. If you have other 5eTools tabs open, you'll need to reload them. You should now see the homebrew content.
